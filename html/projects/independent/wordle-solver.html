<p>During my sophomore year of college, the Wordle game became quite a sensation.  I had never heard of it before, and suddenly, all of my friends were playing it.</p>

<p>After a while, I decided I'd check out what the excitement was about.  After playing a few days, I saw the value in the game... it was very simple and yet very stimulating.</p>

<p>I was taking MIT's Fundamentals of Programming (known then as 6.009 or "six double oh nine" to my peers) at the time, and I had just wanted an amazing video by 3Blue1Brown (see Credits below) about the information theory behind Wordle.  I decided that, given my newfound knowledge of information and programming, it was time for me to develop a bot that could solve Wordle as effectively as possible... or at least, more effectively than I could.  During my week of spring break, I took a few hours and put together a simple program, and EZWordle was born.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Coming soon!</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>During the summer after my junior year, I found this old program and realized that my Rust skills had improved significantly since then.  The original program had a few bugs as well as many memory inefficiencies that wasted a lot of time.  Because of this, I took an evening and redeveloped the program, naming the new and improved program EZWordle2.  It is significantly faster than EZWordle, utilizes less memory, and doesn't trip up on words with double letters as EZWordle did.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code for EZWordle and EZWordle2 is open and available on GitHub.  All source code is licensed under the MIT License.</p>
