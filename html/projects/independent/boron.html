<p>When I was about twelve years old, I saw in Barnes & Noble a book about how to code.  Fascinated, I asked my mother if we could buy it.  Knowing my interest in all things technical, my mother permitted me.  Opening the book, I learned about the Python programming language and some of its basic features.</p>

<p>I read through the exercises contained in the book and quickly taught myself Python.  Little did I know that I would be using it in my college computer science class years later.</p>

<p>From the beginning, I was fascinated by Python's elegant, simple, and readable syntax.  I always wondered if it was possible for me to develop my own computer language... but as a young boy I knew nothing of the great effort involved in developing and maintaining a programming language.</p>

<p>Six years later, after much Internet research and time spent at my laptop, I successfully developed my first programming language: Boron.</p>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>Boron was designed to be easy to read and fast.  Furthermore, I was not and am not very knowledgeable about low-level compiler functionality, and I didn't want to embark on the journey of using LLVM or another compiler toolkit.</p>

<p>Based on my working knowledge of C, I designed the Boron compiler to output raw C that would then be compiled a second time by <em>GCC</em> or another C language compiler.</p>

<h2>Current Features</h2>

<p>Boron currently supports variable definition, loops, functions, and structs.</p>

<h2>Planned Improvements</h2>

<p>My academic work and extracurricular obligations keep me pretty busy, so the Boron language is not currently under active development and no improvements are planned in the near future.</p>

<p>However, future improvements to Boron may include the expansion of its object-oriented capabilities as well as LLVM support.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>The Boron compiler is completely open-source and licensed under the MIT License.  Its source code is available on GitHub.</p>
