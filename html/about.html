<p>Hi!  My name is Joseph, and I'm an incoming Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://covar.com">CoVar</a> in Durham, NC, planning to start work in early August 2025.</p>

<p>I graduated from MIT in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.  I'm very grateful for the diversity of subjects I had the opportunity to study, and my education had a particular focus on unifying analytical, visual, and computational methods in their applications to engineering.  Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, aerospace propulsion, signal processing, and multivariate optimization.  I also enjoy writing code in Python 3 or Rust, my two favorite programming languages.</p>

<p>I'm a cadet in the Army ROTC and plan to commission into the U.S. Army Reserves in late 2025.  Looking ahead, I will be working full-time at CoVar in Durham, and I hope to fulfill my part-time service obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves as a Cyber Capabilities Development Officer.</p>

<p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website!  Please explore it and learn more about the things I've worked on.</p>
