<p>Hello!  My name is Joseph, and I'm an engineer living and working in Durham, NC.</p>

<p>I graduated from MIT in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.  I'm very grateful for the diversity of subjects I had the opportunity to study, and my education had a particular focus on applying novel analytical, visual, and computational methods to the study and practice of engineering.  Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and the intersection of probability theory, underactuated control, and convex optimization.  I also enjoy writing code in Python 3 or Rust, my two favorite programming languages.</p>

<p>In late 2025, I commissioned into the U.S. Army Reserve, and I'll be serving our nation as a Cyber Warfare Officer starting in early 2026.</p>

<p>When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website!  I welcome you to explore it and learn more about the things I've worked on.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>I'd love to hear from you!  The best method for reaching me is electronic mail.  Please contact me at</p>

<img class="full" src="/media/contact.png" alt="My contact information" title="You can also reach me by owl or carrier pigeon, though in practice I've found email most reliable.">

<p>and I will respond within the week.  (I've refrained from providing my address by the normal means to deter web scrapers.)</p>
