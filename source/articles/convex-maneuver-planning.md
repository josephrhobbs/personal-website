# Maneuver Planning

Recently, I've taken a great interest in the intersection of probability theory, optimization, and optimal control.  A recent paper by Z. Manchester's lab of MIT (formerly CMU), "Convex Maneuver Planning for Spacecraft Collision Avoidance" by F. Vega et al., found [here](https://roboticexplorationlab.org/projects/cvx_cola.html), caught my attention recently because it unifies optimal control and probability in the wonderfully fascinating (though incredibly harsh) environment of Earth orbit.  Here, I unpack the paper's main point by presenting a (highly) simplified example of the methodology presented.
