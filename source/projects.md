## Academic

These are projects that I've had the opportunity to work on in a classroom environment.  I did not complete any of these on my own, because strength comes from people working together.  Please see each one for information about my collaborators!

## Open-Source

Open-source work can be massively impactful, so I am grateful for the opportunities (however small) I've had to contribute to the open-source community.  Below, I've summarized my contribution to existing open-source projects.
