# Surge One

In the fall of my senior year, I took MIT's undergraduate capstone course on aircraft design (known to students as 16.82 or "sixteen eight two").  The class focuses on the full systems-level design of flight vehicles through a semester-long project.  I had the pleasure of being a part of a student team developing the Surge One: an ultra-short take-off and landing (uSTOL) aircraft that was designed to serve as an air ambulance or a transport for organ transplantation.

My specialty on the student team was aerodynamics, which meant my responsibility was the sizing and analysis of the wing and tail.  I had to ensure the aircraft would produce sufficient lift for take-off, cruise, and landing cases.  I also had to guarantee passive stability and sufficient control authority.  Please refer to the _Credits_ section for more information about my teammates; my contribution represents approximately one-seventh of the work required to produce the final design.  Our final design was the culmination of nearly 1,000 person-hours of work distributed over thirteen weeks, from early September to early December.

I'm incredibly grateful to my teammates: Gabi McDonald (systems), Mollie Edmondson (weight), Phillip Hood (power), Hakan Chunton (dynamics), Marina Miller (propulsion), and Dana Bell (structures).  My write-up here is only on my contribution to the project, and our final design could never have been possible without the passion, intelligence, and dedication of this amazing team.
