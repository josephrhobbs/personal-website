# Articles

~

I created this website originally to share things about the projects that I've worked on.  However, there are many topics I find very interesting, but I haven't done a "large" or meaningful project about them... hence, I created this page.

These articles cover a variety of topics in mathematics, computer science, engineering, and physics.  I have made my best attempt to ensure these are accessible to an undergraduate engineering or computer science student, but please contact me if you would like clarification on something.  I hope that these articles are interesting to you, and perhaps even educational!
