# Articles

~

I created this website originally to share things about the projects that I've worked on.  However, there are many topics I find very interesting, but I haven't done a "large" or meaningful project about them... hence, I created this page, which is currently under construction.  When completed, I look forward to using this as a place to share short articles about topics in engineering, mathematics, computer science I find fascinating but haven't been related to any of my projects.  I hope that these articles are interesting and perhaps even educational!

\[ 0 = \min_u \left( g(x, u) + \frac{\partial J^\star}{\partial u} f(x, u) \right) \]

\[ Q + A^\mathrm{T} S + S A - S B R^{-1} B^\mathrm{T} S = 0 \]
