Welcome to my website, and thank you for visiting!  If you'd like to learn more about me, or if you're looking to contact me, head on over to [About](/about).

This site catalogs a number of projects I've worked on over the years... I've selected a few to highlight below, but you can see the entire list on the [Projects](/projects) page.

I've also written a few short posts about topics that interest me.  These didn't seem to fit well into a project, so instead I've collected them under [Articles](/articles).
