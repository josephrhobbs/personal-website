Hello!  My name is Joseph, and I am a senior at MIT studying Aerospace Engineering and graduating in May 2025.

Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, structural mechanics, aerodynamics, numerical simulation, software development, and systems engineering.  I also enjoy designing things in Fusion 360 and programming in Python 3 or Rust.

I'm a cadet in the Army ROTC and plan to commission into the U.S. Army Reserves in late 2025.  Looking ahead, I will be working full-time at CoVar in Durham, NC as a Machine Learning Engineer, and I hope to fulfill my part-time service obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves as a Cyber Capabilities Development Officer.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.

Please check out my website and learn more about the things I've worked on!
