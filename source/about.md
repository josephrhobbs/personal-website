Hello!  My name is Joseph, and I'm an engineer living and working in Durham, NC.

I graduated from MIT in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.  I'm very grateful for the diversity of subjects I had the opportunity to study, and my education had a particular focus on applying novel analytical, visual, and computational methods to the study and practice of engineering.  Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and the intersection of probability theory, underactuated control, and convex optimization.  I also enjoy writing code in Python 3 or Rust, my two favorite programming languages.

In late 2025, I commissioned into the U.S. Army Reserve, and I'll be serving our nation as a Cyber Warfare Officer starting in early 2026.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.

Thank you for visiting my website!  I welcome you to explore it and learn more about the things I've worked on.

## Contact

I'd love to hear from you!  The best method for reaching me is electronic mail.  Please contact me at

::titled[My contact information][/media/contact.png][You can also reach me by owl or carrier pigeon, though in practice I've found email most reliable.]

and I will respond within the week.  (I've refrained from providing my address by the normal means to deter web scrapers.)

## Generative AI Statement

I have a great deal of respect for the countless inspired mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers who are building generative models for language, images, and video.  However, I also hold myself to the highest standard of accountability, ownership, and accuracy in everything to which I claim authorship.  Powerful as they may be, generative models can make mistakes... and even more so, using them to digitally "ghostwrite" content is a highly damaging activity and degrades the essentially human activity of writing.  For this reason, it is my decision and my guarantee that __generative models are not used__ for creating, copyediting, or proofreading written content on my website.

You are welcome to learn more about my position on this by reading ["On Generative Models"](/on-generative-models).
