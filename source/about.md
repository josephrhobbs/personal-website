Hi!  My name is Joseph, and I'm an incoming Machine Learning Engineer at [CoVar](https://covar.com) in Durham, NC, planning to start work in early August 2025.

I graduated from MIT in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.  I'm very grateful for the diversity of subjects I had the opportunity to study, and my education had a particular focus on unifying analytical, visual, and computational methods in their applications to engineering.  Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, aerospace propulsion, signal processing, and multivariate optimization.  I also enjoy writing code in Python 3 or Rust, my two favorite programming languages.

I'm a cadet in the Army ROTC and plan to commission into the U.S. Army Reserves in late 2025.  Looking ahead, I will be working full-time at CoVar in Durham, and I hope to fulfill my part-time service obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves as a Cyber Capabilities Development Officer.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.

Thank you for visiting my website!  Please explore it and learn more about the things I've worked on.
