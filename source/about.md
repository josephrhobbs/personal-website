Hello!  My name is Joseph, and I'm an engineer living and working in Durham, NC.

I graduated from MIT in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering.  I'm very grateful for the diversity of subjects I had the opportunity to study, and my education had a particular focus on unifying analytical, visual, and computational methods in their applications to engineering.  Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, aerodynamics, structural mechanics, aerospace propulsion, signal processing, and multivariate optimization.  I also enjoy writing code in Python 3 or Rust, my two favorite programming languages.

In late 2025, I also commissioned into the U.S. Army Reserve, and I'll be serving our nation as a Cyber Warfare Officer starting in early 2026.

When I'm not working or studying, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.

Thank you for visiting my website!  Please explore it and learn more about the things I've worked on.
